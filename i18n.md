# Internationalization (i18n) Guidelines

## Key Labeling in JSON Files

When labeling keys in JSON files for translation, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Descriptive Keys**: Keys should be descriptive and provide context about the text they represent.
2. **CamelCase Format**: Use camelCase for key names or lowercase for dynamic keys.
3. **Use Subsections for Keys**: Create subsections for keys to group related translations together.

### Example

```json
{
    "header": {
        "title": "Welcome",
        "subtitle": "Your journey starts here"
    },
    "footer": {
        "contact": "Contact Us"
    }
}
```

## Naming Translation Files

Translation files should be named according to the following conventions:

1. **Common File**: Use `common.json` for translations that are used across multiple routes or components.
2. **Route-Specific Files**: Name files based on the first segment of the route they correspond to.

### Example

For a route `/dashboard/settings`, the translation file should be named `dashboard.json`.

### File Structure

```
/en
    ├── common.json
    ├── dashboard.json
    └── profile.json
```

By following these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and maintainable approach to internationalization in your project.
