## 1. Fundamental Principles

These core principles apply to virtually every interaction with language models and form the foundation of effective prompt engineering.

### 1.1. Clarity and Specificity

**The Golden Rule**: Be as specific, descriptive, and detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style.

**❌ Vague Example:**
```
Write a poem about OpenAI.
```

**✅ Specific Example:**
```
Write a short, inspiring poem about OpenAI, focusing on the recent DALL-E product launch (DALL-E is a text-to-image ML model) in the style of Robert Frost. The poem should be 3 stanzas, each with 4 lines.
```

### 1.2. Structure and Organization

**Place instructions at the beginning** and use clear delimiters (e.g., `###`, `"""`, or `````) to separate different parts of your prompt.

**Template Structure:**
```
[Main Instruction]

[Specific Requirements/Constraints]

[Input Delimiter] ### or """ or ```
[Context/Data to Process]
[End Delimiter]

[Output Format Specification]
```

**Example:**
```
Summarize the text below as a bullet point list of the most important points.

Requirements:
- Maximum 5 bullets
- Each bullet should be 10-15 words
- Focus on actionable insights

Text: """
{text input here}
"""

Format:
• Point 1
• Point 2
• Point 3
```

### 1.3. Positive Instruction Pattern

**Say what TO do, not just what NOT to do.** Provide clear alternatives and desired behaviors.

**❌ Negative Pattern:**
```
The following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. DO NOT ASK USERNAME OR PASSWORD. DO NOT REPEAT.

Customer: I can't log in to my account.
Agent:
```

**✅ Positive Pattern:**
```
The following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. The agent will attempt to diagnose the problem and suggest a solution, whilst refraining from asking any questions related to PII. Instead of asking for PII, such as username or password, refer the user to the help article www.samplewebsite.com/help/faq

Customer: I can't log in to my account.
Agent:
```

## 2. Core Prompting Strategies

### 2.1. Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting

#### Zero-Shot Prompting
Direct instruction without examples. Best for simple, well-defined tasks.

**Example:**
```
Extract keywords from the text below.

Text: "Stripe provides APIs that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications."

Keywords:
```

#### Few-Shot Prompting
Provide 2-5 high-quality examples to teach the model the desired pattern, format, and scope.

**Example:**
```
Extract keywords from the corresponding texts below.

Text 1: Stripe provides APIs that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications.
Keywords 1: Stripe, payment processing, APIs, web developers, websites, mobile applications

Text 2: OpenAI has trained cutting-edge language models that are very good at understanding and generating text. Our API provides access to these models and can be used to solve virtually any task that involves processing language.
Keywords 2: OpenAI, language models, text processing, API

Text 3: {your text here}
Keywords 3:
```

**Best Practices for Few-Shot:**
- Use consistent formatting across all examples.
- Show positive patterns (what to do) rather than anti-patterns (what not to do).
- Include 2-5 examples (more can cause overfitting).
- Ensure examples are diverse but follow the same pattern.

### 2.2. Adding Context

Don't assume the model knows everything. Include relevant information directly in the prompt.

**Template:**
```
Answer the question using the context provided below. Respond only based on the given information. If the answer isn’t present, reply "Not found in provided text."

Context: """
[Relevant information, documentation, or background]
"""

Question: [Your question]

Answer:
```

### 2.3. Output Format Specification

Clearly define the structure you want for responses. This makes outputs more predictable and easier to parse programmatically.

**Template:**
```
Extract the following information from the text. Output strictly this JSON (no extra text):

Desired format:
{
	"company_names": ["<list_of_strings>"],
	"people_names": ["<list_of_strings>"],
	"specific_topics": ["<list_of_strings>"],
	"general_themes": ["<list_of_strings>"]
}

Text: {text}
```

## 3. Advanced Frameworks

These sophisticated patterns are used in professional AI tools and can dramatically improve performance for complex tasks.

### 3.1. Task Decomposition Framework

**Purpose:** Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps with explicit tracking, preventing the AI from getting lost in multi-step processes.

**Template:**
```
For this complex task, I need you to:

1. Break down the task into 5-7 specific steps.
2. For each step, provide:
   - Clear success criteria
   - Required information
3. Work through each step sequentially.
4. Before moving to the next step, verify the current step is complete.
5. If a step fails, troubleshoot before continuing.

Let's solve: [your complex problem]
```

### 3.2. Contextual Reasoning Pattern

**Purpose:** Forces the AI to explicitly consider different contexts and scenarios before making decisions, resulting in more nuanced and reliable outputs.

**Template:**
```
Before answering my question, consider these different contexts:

1. If this is about [context A], key considerations would be: [list]
2. If this is about [context B], key considerations would be: [list]  
3. If this is about [context C], key considerations would be: [list]

Based on these contexts, determine which applies and answer: [your question]
```

### 3.3. Tool Selection Framework

**Purpose:** Helps the AI make better decisions about what approach to use for different types of problems.

**Template:**
```
When solving this problem, first determine which approach is most appropriate:

1. If it requires searching/finding information: Use systematic research approach.
2. If it requires comparing alternatives: Use comparative analysis framework.
3. If it requires step-by-step reasoning: Use logical decomposition method.
4. If it requires creative generation: Use ideation and refinement process.

For my task: [your task]

Selected approach: [AI identifies the approach]
Reasoning: [AI explains why this approach fits]
Solution: [AI applies the selected approach]
```

### 3.4. Verification Loop Pattern

**Purpose:** Builds in explicit verification steps, dramatically reducing errors in AI outputs.

**Template:**
```
For this task, use this verification process:

1. Generate an initial solution.
2. Identify potential issues using these checks:
   - [Check 1: Logic and consistency]
   - [Check 2: Adherence to constraints]
   - [Check 3: Format and requirements compliance]
3. Fix any issues found.
4. Verify the solution again.
5. Provide the final verified result.

Task: [your task]
```

### 3.5. Communication Style Framework

**Purpose:** Gives the AI specific guidelines on how to structure responses for maximum clarity and usefulness.

**Template:**
```
When answering, follow these communication guidelines:

1. Start with the most important information.
2. Use section headers only when they improve clarity.
3. Group related points together.
4. For technical details, use bullet points with bold keywords.
5. Include specific examples for abstract concepts.
6. End with clear next steps or implications.

My question: [your question]
```

## 4. Model Parameters & Control

Understanding and adjusting model parameters can significantly improve output quality and consistency.

### Key Parameters

- **Temperature**: Controls randomness.
  - **0.0-0.3**: Highly deterministic, best for factual content, analysis, code, and extraction.
  - **0.4-0.7**: Balanced, good for most general tasks.
  - **0.8-1.0+**: Creative, good for brainstorming and creative writing.

- **Max Tokens**: Sets the maximum length of the response. Plan for:
  - **Short answers**: 50-150 tokens
  - **Paragraphs**: 150-500 tokens
  - **Long-form content**: 500-2000+ tokens

- **Top-P and Top-K**: Fine-tune token selection by controlling nucleus sampling (Top-P) or limiting vocabulary choices (Top-K). It's often best to tune Temperature first.

- **Stop Sequences**: Define a set of characters that will cause the model to stop generating text, preventing run-on responses.
  ```python
  stop_sequences = ["###", "END", "\n\n---"]
  ```

## 5. Iterative Development Process

Effective prompt engineering is iterative. Follow this systematic approach:

1.  **Start Simple (Zero-Shot)**: Begin with a clear, direct instruction.
2.  **Add Examples (Few-Shot)**: If results aren't consistent, add 2-3 high-quality examples.
3.  **Refine Instructions**: Make requirements more specific (e.g., "Summarize in exactly 3 bullet points, 10-15 words each").
4.  **Experiment with Order**: Try different arrangements of instructions, examples, and input data.
5.  **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune temperature, max tokens, and other settings based on results.

Required fields:
- Company name: 
- Industry:
- Key products/services:
- Target market:
- Revenue (if mentioned):

Text: """
{input_text}
"""

Format your response as:
Company: [name]
Industry: [industry]  
Products: [list]
Market: [description]
Revenue: [amount or "Not specified"]
```

### Code Generation Template
```
Generate [language] code that accomplishes the following task:

Task: [specific description]

Requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]

Include:
- Clear comments explaining key sections
- Error handling for common edge cases
- Example usage

Code:
```

### Analysis Template
```
Analyze the following [data/text/situation] using this framework:

1. **Current State**: What is the present situation?
2. **Key Issues**: What are the main problems or challenges?
3. **Root Causes**: What underlying factors contribute to these issues?
4. **Recommendations**: What specific actions should be taken?
5. **Expected Outcomes**: What results can be expected from these actions?

Data/Context: """
{input}
"""

Analysis:
```

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Vague Instructions**: Instead of "Make this text better," use "Rewrite this text to be more concise, using active voice and removing jargon. Target length: 100-150 words."
- **Assuming Knowledge**: Don't assume the model knows your specific context. Provide all necessary background information in the prompt.
- **Inconsistent Examples**: Maintain a consistent structure and format across all few-shot examples.
- **Overcomplicating**: Break complex tasks into smaller, focused prompts instead of trying to accomplish too much in one.
- **Ignoring Parameters**: Don't use default settings for all tasks. Adjust temperature and other parameters based on your use case.
- **Not Iterating**: Don't expect perfect results on the first try. Test, refine, and improve your prompts systematically.
