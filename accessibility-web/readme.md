# Web Accessibility

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so ALL the people can use them. More specifically, people can:

- Perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web.
- Contribute to the Web.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.
